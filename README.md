Hello

Fig 2.  A& B& C
In “Comparison” file,  at the file “Hmeta_drugs.Rmd”. These codes call the functions from “HMeta-d-master-Fleming,S/R”

Fig 3. A&F & C&G
In “Comparison” file,  at the file “MBMF_contribution.Rmd”, there are codes for visualization and statistics on the regression results. The regression analysis was done with Matlab codes, written by “Rani Moran”, in the “Matlab-codes/MBMF_contributions_regression.m”.
Fig 3. D&H
In “Comparison” file,  at the file “Conf_MFMB.Rmd”, there are codes for visualization and statistics on the regression results. The regression analysis was done with Matlab codes, written by “Rani Moran”, in the “Matlab-codes/Conf_MFMB_regression.m”.


In the “Comparison” file, the “ReadData.Rmd” would read the data from Two-outcome task across three days, also would save the order of drugs across participants.


In the “Comparison” file, the” Fitting.Rmd” would fit the data to the hybrid model and compares the parameters across three drug conditions by visualization and statistical tests. The Fitting procedure is based on “fit/linkfitreal.R" and “simu/simufit.R" files.
